Tsunami
==============

**Tsunami** is an experimental BitTorrent client with magical anonymity powers.

You shouldn't use this yet. Or maybe ever. But, if you know me and what I'm about and this intrigues you, let me know and let's chat.

Project Goals
-------------

* Anonymous (to non-global adversaries)
* Works with the existing BitTorrent network
* Usably fast
* Easy to use, works out of the box
* Cross platform (Linux, OSX, Windows, mobile, in that order)
* Completely free to use (no VPN subscription)
* 100% Free Software!
* Essentially, be the holy grail of P2P software

Usage
------------
* Don't use this yet.
